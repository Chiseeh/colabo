Physical Properties of Matter
There are currently five states of matter. The most common are solid, liquid, and gas.
Critical temperatures including melting point, boiling point, and Curie temperature. The melting point is also the freezing point and sometimes this process is called fusion, as in heat of fusion for enthalpy. The Curie temperature for a material is where it transitions from being magnetic to being non-magnetic.
Electrical conductivity and resistivity. The units of conductivity are ohms and for resistivity it used the word ohm reversed. That is, the resistivity is in mhos.
